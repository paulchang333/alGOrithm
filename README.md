# Flicker

A Tinder-esque web app designed to make the process of choosing a movie or show to watch on Netflix with a group more efficient. Swipe right on the card to accept, left to reject, and once everyone is finished making their decisions, the group's strongest recommendations will be displayed for everyone to see.

Data from Netflix was collected using the unofficial Netflix API, uNoGS.
